# Class-Opener
To open the online meet automatically by voice

When we are in online class we need to attend the daily classes on google meet. So for every class we need to join different meet. For that it takes times to go and search for the link and to join . For that we have created this Class Opener(voice recognition) with our basic knowledge of Python Programming .If we voice the subject name it will automatically redirect to the respected meet at the respected timing.
